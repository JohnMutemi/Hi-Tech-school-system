  - High (KES 50,000+)
- **Priority Level Filter**: High, Medium, Low, None
- **Grade and Class Filtering**
- **Search functionality** (name, admission number, parent)
- **Clear all filters** button

### 6. **Bulk Operations**
- **Multi-select functionality** with checkboxes
- **Select all/none** toggle
- **Bulk balance refresh** for selected students
- **Bulk export** of selected student data
- **Visual selection indicators** (row highlighting)
- **Bulk operation progress tracking**

### 7. **Enhanced User Interface**
- **Payment progress bars** showing percentage paid
- **Real-time status badges** with color coding
- **Priority indicators** with appropriate urgency levels
- **Enhanced table layout** with improved readability
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop
- **Loading states** and animation feedback

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Real-Time Data Flow
```typescript
// Auto-refresh mechanism
useEffect(() => {
  if (autoRefresh) {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      fetchStudents();
      setLastRefresh(new Date());
    }, 30000); // 30-second intervals
    
    setRefreshInterval(interval);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }
}, [autoRefresh, schoolCode, selectedGrade, selectedClass, academicYear, term]);
```

### Enhanced Filtering Logic
```typescript
// Multi-criteria filtering
const filterStudents = () => {
  let filtered = students;
  
  // Apply search, fee status, balance range, and priority filters
  if (feeStatusFilter !== 'all') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(student => getFeeStatus(student) === feeStatusFilter);
  }
  
  if (balanceRangeFilter !== 'all') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(student => {
      const balance = student.balance || 0;
      // Balance range logic...
    });
  }
  
  // Priority and search filters...
};
```

### Bulk Operations Implementation
```typescript
// Bulk refresh functionality
const bulkRefreshBalances = async () => {
  setBulkProcessing(true);
  const selectedStudentIds = Array.from(selectedStudents);
  const promises = selectedStudentIds.map(id => refreshStudentBalance(id));
  await Promise.all(promises);
  
  toast({
    title: 'Bulk Refresh Complete',
    description: `Updated balances for ${selectedStudentIds.length} students`,
  });
};
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements

### Visual Indicators
- **Color-coded status badges** for immediate recognition
- **Progress bars** showing payment completion percentage  
- **Priority badges** highlighting urgent payment needs
- **Row highlighting** for selected students
- **Real-time timestamp** display

### Interactive Elements
- **Checkbox selection** for bulk operations
- **Auto-refresh toggle** with ON/OFF states
- **Filter dropdowns** with comprehensive options
- **Action buttons** with loading states
- **Responsive layout** adapting to screen sizes

## 🚀 Key Differences from Parent Dashboard

### Enhanced Capabilities for Bursars
1. **School-wide Access**: Manage fees for ALL students vs. parent's children only
2. **Bulk Operations**: Process multiple students simultaneously
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by fee status, balance ranges, and priorities
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Auto-refresh capabilities for live monitoring
5. **Priority Management**: Identify and prioritize high-balance students
6. **Bulk Export**: Export selected student data for reporting

### Administrative Features
- **Multi-select functionality** for efficient batch operations
- **Priority-based filtering** to focus on urgent cases
- **Comprehensive reporting** with CSV export capabilities
- **Real-time dashboard updates** for accurate monitoring

## 📊 Data Flow Architecture

```
Bursar Dashboard → API Endpoints → Database
     ↓              ↓                ↓
1. Student List  → /students/balances → Real-time balance calculation
2. Payment Hub   → /payments/process → Payment recording & balance updates  
3. Auto-refresh  → Real-time polling → Automatic data synchronization
4. Bulk Operations → Parallel API calls → Efficient batch processing
```
