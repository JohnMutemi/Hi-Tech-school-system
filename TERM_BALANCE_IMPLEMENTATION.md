- **Improvement**: Term closing rows now properly display debit/credit amounts instead of empty values
- **Logic**: 
  ```typescript
  debit: termRunningBalance > 0 ? termRunningBalance : 0,
  credit: termRunningBalance < 0 ? Math.abs(termRunningBalance) : 0,
  ```

### 2. Visual Enhancement in Component Display
- **Location**: `components/fees-statement/FeesStatementDownload.tsx`

  - **Star Icon (★)**: Added to term balance rows for immediate visual identification
  - **Color-coded Backgrounds**: 
    - Red background for outstanding balances
    - Green background for paid/zero balances
  - **Status Badges**: "OUTSTANDING" or "PAID" badges next to term descriptions
  - **Larger Font**: Term balance amounts displayed in larger, bold text
  - **Border Styling**: Left border with amber accent for emphasis

### 3. PDF Generation Enhancement
- **Location**: `app/api/schools/[schoolCode]/students/[studentId]/fee-statement/pdf/route.ts`
- **Improvement**: Term closing rows now include proper debit/credit values and star indicators
- **Format**: Consistent with web display styling

### 4. HTML View Enhancement
- **Location**: `app/api/schools/[schoolCode]/students/[studentId]/fee-statement/view/route.ts`
- **Features**:
  - **Special Row Handling**: Different styling for term headers, term closings, and brought-forward balances
  - **Color-coded Term Balances**: Red for outstanding, green for paid
  - **Visual Indicators**: Star icons and enhanced typography

### 5. Download Route Consistency
- **Location**: `app/api/schools/[schoolCode]/students/[studentId]/fee-statement/download/route.ts`
- **Improvement**: Consistent handling of special row types across all export formats

## Visual Design Elements

### Term Balance Row Styling
```css
/* Outstanding Balance */
background: #fee2e2 (light red)

```

### Typography Enhancements

- **Icons**: Star (★) symbol for immediate recognition

## Data Structure

### Term Closing Row Structure
```typescript
{
  no: '',
  ref: '',
  description: 'TERM TERM 1 BALANCE',
  debit: termRunningBalance > 0 ? termRunningBalance : 0,
  credit: termRunningBalance < 0 ? Math.abs(termRunningBalance) : 0,
  date: termGroup.transactions[termGroup.transactions.length - 1]?.date,
  type: 'term-closing',
  termId: termGroup.termId,
  termName: termGroup.termName,
  academicYearId: termGroup.academicYearId,
  academicYearName: termGroup.academicYearName,

  termBalance: termRunningBalance,
  isClosingBalance: true
