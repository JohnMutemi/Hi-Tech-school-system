# M-PESA Integration Setup for SaaS Platform

## Overview
This is a **Software as a Service (SaaS)** platform where each school configures their own M-PESA credentials. The platform provides the payment infrastructure while schools maintain their own merchant accounts.

## Environment Variables Required (Platform Level)

Add these to your `.env` file for the platform:

```env
# Your Daraja API credentials (for platform access)
DARAJA_CONSUMER_KEY=GCVRNFZmYKGhptfaSxrJy1o4aBErLfQmvJla4gKdziKcWxZK
DARAJA_CONSUMER_SECRET=rQGB4YyOXo6cXFhaUrEPx8dG5UVfprLk0AwkyghAfGXpazS8tT4ZT7g3QvMOscXo

# Environment (sandbox or production)
DARAJA_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
```
