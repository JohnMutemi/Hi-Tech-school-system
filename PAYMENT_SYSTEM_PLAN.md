# Comprehensive Payment System Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines a comprehensive but simple sequential payment logic for the school management system, focusing on term fee payments with MPESA simulation, balance tracking, overpayment handling, and receipt generation.

## System Architecture

### 1. Core Payment Component Structure

```
components/payment/
├── PaymentHub.tsx              # Main unified payment component
├── PaymentSimulator.tsx        # MPESA simulation component
├── TermBalanceDisplay.tsx      # Term balance and academic year balance
├── PaymentHistory.tsx          # Payment history with download receipts
├── ReceiptGenerator.tsx        # Receipt generation and download
├── OverpaymentHandler.tsx      # Overpayment logic and carry-forward
└── types/
    └── payment-types.ts        # TypeScript interfaces
```

### 2. Database Schema Extensions

#### Payment Table Enhancements
```sql
-- Add fields for overpayment handling
ALTER TABLE Payment ADD COLUMN carryForwardAmount DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE Payment ADD COLUMN appliedToTerm VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE Payment ADD COLUMN appliedToAcademicYear VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE Payment ADD COLUMN overpaymentAmount DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
```

#### Receipt Table Enhancements
```sql
-- Add fields for comprehensive receipt data
ALTER TABLE Receipt ADD COLUMN termBalanceAfter DECIMAL(10,2);
ALTER TABLE Receipt ADD COLUMN academicYearBalanceAfter DECIMAL(10,2);
ALTER TABLE Receipt ADD COLUMN carryForwardAmount DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE Receipt ADD COLUMN overpaymentAmount DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE Receipt ADD COLUMN feeBreakdown JSON;
```

## 3. Sequential Payment Logic Flow

### Phase 1: Payment Initiation
1. **Student Selection**: Parent selects child from ChildrenSection
2. **Fee Assessment**: System calculates current term and academic year balances
3. **Payment Method Selection**: Choose between MPESA simulation or manual payment
4. **Amount Validation**: Ensure payment amount is valid and sufficient

### Phase 2: MPESA Simulation
1. **Phone Number Input**: Collect MPESA-registered phone number
2. **Payment Simulation**: Simulate MPESA payment process
3. **Transaction ID Generation**: Generate unique transaction reference
4. **Payment Confirmation**: Confirm successful payment simulation

### Phase 3: Balance Calculation & Application
1. **Term Balance Calculation**: Calculate current term outstanding
2. **Academic Year Balance**: Calculate total academic year outstanding
3. **Payment Application**: Apply payment to current term first
4. **Overpayment Handling**: If overpayment, carry forward to next term
5. **Balance Updates**: Update both term and academic year balances

### Phase 4: Receipt Generation
1. **Receipt Data Compilation**: Gather all payment and balance data
2. **Fee Breakdown**: Include detailed fee structure breakdown
3. **Balance Summary**: Show before/after balances for term and academic year
4. **Download Generation**: Create downloadable PDF receipt

## 4. Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Unified Payment Hub Component

**File**: `components/payment/PaymentHub.tsx`

```typescript
interface PaymentHubProps {
  studentId: string;
  schoolCode: string;
  onPaymentComplete: (receipt: ReceiptData) => void;
}

interface PaymentState {
  currentStep: 'selection' | 'simulation' | 'processing' | 'complete';
  selectedTerm: string;
  paymentAmount: number;
  phoneNumber: string;
  isProcessing: boolean;
}
```

**Features**:
- Unified payment flow management
- Step-by-step payment wizard
- Real-time balance updates
- Error handling and validation

### Step 2: Implement MPESA Simulation

**File**: `components/payment/PaymentSimulator.tsx`

```typescript
interface MPESASimulationProps {
  amount: number;
  phoneNumber: string;
  onSuccess: (transactionId: string) => void;
  onError: (error: string) => void;
}
```

**Simulation Features**:
- Phone number validation (Kenyan format)
- Payment processing animation
- Transaction ID generation
- Success/error state handling
- Realistic MPESA-like interface

### Step 3: Term Balance Display Component

**File**: `components/payment/TermBalanceDisplay.tsx`

```typescript
interface BalanceData {
  currentTerm: string;
  currentTermBalance: number;
  academicYearBalance: number;
  nextTermBalance: number;
  carryForwardAmount: number;
  overpaymentAmount: number;
}
```

**Features**:
- Real-time balance display
- Term-by-term breakdown
- Academic year summary
- Overpayment indicators
- Balance history chart

### Step 4: Payment History with Receipt Download

**File**: `components/payment/PaymentHistory.tsx`

```typescript
interface PaymentHistoryProps {
  studentId: string;
  academicYear: string;
  onDownloadReceipt: (paymentId: string) => void;
}
```

**Features**:
- Chronological payment list
- Filter by term/academic year
- Download receipt functionality
- Payment status indicators
- Search and filter options

### Step 5: Receipt Generator

**File**: `components/payment/ReceiptGenerator.tsx`

```typescript
interface ReceiptData {
  receiptNumber: string;
  paymentDate: Date;
  studentInfo: StudentData;
  paymentDetails: PaymentDetails;
  balanceBreakdown: BalanceBreakdown;
  feeBreakdown: FeeBreakdown[];
  academicYearSummary: AcademicYearSummary;
}
```

**Receipt Features**:
- Professional receipt layout
- Complete fee breakdown
- Balance before/after payment
- Academic year summary
- PDF download capability
- School branding integration

## 5. Overpayment Handling Logic

### Algorithm for Overpayment Processing

```typescript
function handleOverpayment(
  paymentAmount: number,
  currentTermBalance: number,
  nextTermBalance: number
): OverpaymentResult {
  const overpayment = paymentAmount - currentTermBalance;
  
  if (overpayment > 0) {
    // Apply to current term first
    const appliedToCurrent = currentTermBalance;
    const carryForward = overpayment;
    
    // Update next term balance
    const newNextTermBalance = Math.max(0, nextTermBalance - carryForward);
    
    return {
      appliedToCurrent,
      carryForward,
      newNextTermBalance,
      overpaymentAmount: overpayment
    };
  }
  
  return {
    appliedToCurrent: paymentAmount,
    carryForward: 0,
    newNextTermBalance: nextTermBalance,
    overpaymentAmount: 0
  };
}
```

## 6. API Endpoints Structure

### Payment Processing API
```
POST /api/schools/[schoolCode]/payments/simulate
POST /api/schools/[schoolCode]/payments/process
GET /api/schools/[schoolCode]/students/[studentId]/balances
GET /api/schools/[schoolCode]/students/[studentId]/payment-history
GET /api/schools/[schoolCode]/payments/[paymentId]/receipt
```

### Balance Calculation API
```
GET /api/schools/[schoolCode]/students/[studentId]/fees
GET /api/schools/[schoolCode]/students/[studentId]/term-balances
GET /api/schools/[schoolCode]/students/[studentId]/academic-year-balance
```

## 7. Integration with Existing Components

### ChildrenSection Integration
```typescript
// In ChildrenSection.tsx
import PaymentHub from '@/components/payment/PaymentHub';

// Add payment tab to student details
<Tabs defaultValue="details">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="details">Details</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="payment">Payment</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="history">Payment History</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  
  <TabsContent value="payment">
    <PaymentHub 
      studentId={selectedStudent.id}
      schoolCode={schoolCode}
      onPaymentComplete={handlePaymentComplete}
    />
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>
```

## 8. Academic Year and Promotion Logic

### Current Academic Year Reference
```typescript
function getCurrentAcademicYear(schoolId: string): Promise<AcademicYear> {
  return prisma.academicYear.findFirst({
    where: {
      schoolId,
      isCurrent: true
    }
  });
}
```

### Promotion Logic Integration
```typescript
function shouldUseNextAcademicYear(student: Student): boolean {
  // Check if student is promoted to next class
  const isPromoted = checkPromotionStatus(student);
  return isPromoted;
}
```
