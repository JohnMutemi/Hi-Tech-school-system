# Grade Restriction Implementation - Grades 1-6 Only

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved

You reported that when creating fee structures, you were seeing grades 1-8, but you only want grades 1-6. This has been fixed.

## âœ… What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Updated Seed Script** (`/scripts/seed-grades.js`)
- âœ… Changed from creating grades 1-8 to grades 1-6 only
- âœ… Now only creates: Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, Grade 4, Grade 5, Grade 6

### 2. **Updated Grades API** (`/lib/school-context.ts`)
- âœ… Modified `getGrades()` method to only return grades 1-6
- âœ… Added filtering to exclude grades 7-8
- âœ… Added proper ordering (Grade 1, Grade 2, etc.)

### 3. **Cleanup Script** (`/scripts/cleanup-grades.js`)
- âœ… Removes existing grades 7-8 from all schools
- âœ… Safely handles grades with existing classes/students
- âœ… Creates missing grades 1-6 if they don't exist
- âœ… Provides detailed reporting

### 4. **Updated Test Script** (`/scripts/test-school-isolation.ts`)
- âœ… Added validation to only allow grades 1-6
- âœ… Prevents creation of invalid grades during testing

## ðŸš€ How to Apply the Changes

### 1. **Run the Cleanup Script**
```bash
npm run cleanup:grades
```

This will:
- Remove grades 7-8 from all schools (if they have no classes/students)
- Create missing grades 1-6
- Show you exactly what was changed
- Provide a final verification report

### 2. **Verify the Changes**
After running the cleanup script, you should see:
```
ðŸŽ‰ Grade cleanup completed!
   Removed: X grades (7-8)
   Kept/Created: Y grades (1-6)
   Total valid grades: Y

ðŸ“Š Final verification:
   Total grades 1-6 across all schools: Z
   Expected: Z grades (6 grades Ã— X schools)
   âœ… All schools have exactly grades 1-6
```

### 3. **Test the Fee Structure Creation**
- Go to your fee structure creation page
- You should now only see grades 1-6 in the dropdown
- No more grades 7-8 should appear

## ðŸ”’ Safety Features

### **Data Protection**
- The cleanup script **will NOT delete** grades that have classes or students
- It will warn you if a grade has data and skip deletion
- You'll need to manually move students/classes before deletion

### **Validation**
- All grade creation now validates against the allowed list (1-6)
- API endpoints only return grades 1-6
- Test scripts prevent creation of invalid grades

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

After running the cleanup script:

- âœ… **Fee structure creation** will only show grades 1-6
- âœ… **All schools** will have exactly grades 1-6
- âœ… **No grades 7-8** will exist in the system
- âœ… **Existing data** is protected from accidental deletion

## ðŸŽ¯ API Changes

### **Before:**
```typescript
// Could return grades 1-8
const grades = await schoolManager.getGrades();
```

### **After:**
```typescript
// Only returns grades 1-6
const grades = await schoolManager.getGrades();
// Returns: ['Grade 1', 'Grade 2', 'Grade 3', 'Grade 4', 'Grade 5', 'Grade 6']
```

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

### **If You Have Data in Grades 7-8**
If the cleanup script finds grades 7-8 with existing classes or students:

1. **Don't panic** - the script will NOT delete them
2. **Manual action required** - you'll need to:
   - Move students from grades 7-8 to grades 1-6
   - Move classes from grades 7-8 to grades 1-6
   - Then re-run the cleanup script

### **For New Schools**
- New schools will automatically get grades 1-6 only
- The seed script has been updated to prevent grades 7-8

## ðŸ“ž Next Steps

1. **Run the cleanup script**: `npm run cleanup:grades`
2. **Verify fee structure creation** only shows grades 1-6
3. **Test with multiple schools** to ensure consistency
4. **Monitor for any issues** with existing data

Your system now enforces the grade 1-6 restriction across all functionality! ðŸŽ‰
