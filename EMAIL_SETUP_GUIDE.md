# ðŸ“§ Email Notification Setup Guide

## Database Migration & Backend Setup

### 1. **Database Schema**
âœ… **Already Included**: The email notification tables are already defined in your Prisma schema:
- `EmailNotificationConfig` - Stores email provider settings per school
- `PaymentNotificationLog` - Tracks all email notifications sent

### 2. **Run Migration (If Needed)**
If the tables don't exist in your database, run:

```bash
# Apply the migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_email_notifications

# Or for production
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### 3. **Setup Email Configurations for Existing Schools**
Run the setup script to create default email configurations:

```bash
node scripts/setup-email-notifications.js
```

This will:
- Create email configurations for all schools (disabled by default)
- Set Gmail as the default provider
- Use school email/name as defaults

### 4. **Environment Variables**
Add to your `.env.local`:

```env
# Required for receipt download URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com
# For development:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
