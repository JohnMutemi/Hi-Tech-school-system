## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Payment table enhancements
ALTER TABLE Payment ADD COLUMN carryForwardAmount DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE Payment ADD COLUMN appliedToTerm VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE Payment ADD COLUMN appliedToAcademicYear VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE Payment ADD COLUMN overpaymentAmount DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;

-- Receipt table enhancements
ALTER TABLE Receipt ADD COLUMN termBalanceAfter DECIMAL(10,2);
ALTER TABLE Receipt ADD COLUMN academicYearBalanceAfter DECIMAL(10,2);
ALTER TABLE Receipt ADD COLUMN carryForwardAmount DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE Receipt ADD COLUMN overpaymentAmount DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE Receipt ADD COLUMN feeBreakdown JSON;
```

### Core Components Structure
```
components/payment/
├── PaymentHub.tsx              # Main unified payment component
├── PaymentSimulator.tsx        # MPESA simulation component
└── types/
    └── payment-types.ts        # TypeScript interfaces
```

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/schools/[schoolCode]/payments/process
GET /api/schools/[schoolCode]/students/[studentId]/payment-history
GET /api/schools/[schoolCode]/payments/[paymentId]/receipt
```

## 🚀 How to Use the Payment System

### For Parents
1. **Select Child**: Choose from the dropdown in ChildrenSection
2. **Navigate to Payment Tab**: Click the "Payment" tab
3. **View Balance**: See current term and academic year balances
4. **Choose Payment Method**: Select MPESA or manual payment
5. **Enter Details**: Amount and phone number (for MPESA)
6. **Process Payment**: Click "Process Payment" button
7. **View History**: Switch to "History" tab to see all payments
8. **Download Receipts**: Click download button on any payment

### For Developers
1. **Integration**: PaymentHub is already integrated into ChildrenSection
2. **Customization**: Modify PaymentHub props for different use cases
3. **Styling**: All components use Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
4. **API Calls**: All endpoints follow RESTful conventions

## 💡 Key Features in Detail

### 1. MPESA Simulation
```typescript
// Realistic 5-step simulation
const simulationSteps = [
  { id: "initiate", title: "Initiating Payment", duration: 1000 },
  { id: "validate", title: "Validating Phone Number", duration: 1500 },
  { id: "send-pin", title: "Sending PIN Request", duration: 2000 },
  { id: "process", title: "Processing Payment", duration: 3000 },
  { id: "confirm", title: "Confirming Transaction", duration: 1500 }
];
```

### 2. Overpayment Algorithm
```typescript
function handleOverpayment(paymentAmount, currentTermBalance, nextTermBalance) {
  const overpayment = paymentAmount - currentTermBalance;
  
  if (overpayment > 0) {
    return {
      appliedToCurrent: currentTermBalance,
      carryForward: overpayment,
      newNextTermBalance: Math.max(0, nextTermBalance - carryForward),
      overpaymentAmount: overpayment
    };
  }
  
  return {
    appliedToCurrent: paymentAmount,
    carryForward: 0,
    newNextTermBalance: nextTermBalance,
    overpaymentAmount: 0
  };
}
```

### 3. Receipt Generation
- **Professional Layout**: School branding and official styling
- **Complete Information**: Payment details, student info, balances
- **Overpayment Notices**: Clear indication of carry-forward amounts
- **Balance Summary**: Before/after balances for term and academic year
- **Fee Breakdown**: Detailed fee structure information

## 📊 Data Flow

### Payment Processing Flow
1. **User Input** → PaymentHub validates form data
2. **MPESA Simulation** → PaymentSimulator processes payment steps
3. **API Call** → `/api/schools/[schoolCode]/payments/process`
4. **Balance Calculation** → Calculate current and next term balances
5. **Overpayment Handling** → Apply excess to next term if needed
6. **Database Update** → Create payment and receipt records
7. **UI Update** → Refresh balance display and payment history
8. **Receipt Generation** → Generate downloadable receipt

### Balance Calculation Flow
1. **Fetch Fee Structures** → Get all active fee structures for student's grade
2. **Fetch Payments** → Get all payments for the academic year
3. **Calculate Charges** → Sum all fee structure amounts
4. **Calculate Payments** → Sum all payment amounts
5. **Determine Outstanding** → Charges - Payments = Outstanding
6. **Term-wise Breakdown** → Calculate per-term balances
7. **Apply Carry Forward** → Handle overpayments from previous terms

      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(paymentData)
    });
    
    if (response.ok) {
      const receipt = await response.json();
      // Handle successful payment
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle payment error
  }
};
```
