# Student Promotion System - Implementation Summary

## âœ… **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION**

Your proposed promotion logic has been successfully implemented! Here's what has been completed:

### **Phase 1: Core Service Layer** âœ…

- **Created:** `lib/services/promotion-service.ts`
  - Bulk promotion logic for entire school
  - Academic year/term creation with convention following
  - Arrears management and carry-forward
  - Class progression handling

### **Phase 2: New API Endpoints** âœ…

- **Created:** `app/api/schools/[schoolCode]/promotions/bulk/route.ts`
  - `POST` - Execute school-wide bulk promotion
  - `GET?action=preview` - Preview promotion plan
  - `GET?action=current-status` - Check current academic year/term

### **Phase 3: Updated Existing API** âœ…

- **Updated:** `app/api/schools/[schoolCode]/promotions/route.ts`
  - Removed academic year/term change logic
  - Only class movement logic retained
  - Updated promotion logs accordingly

### **Phase 4: Enhanced UI** âœ…

- **Updated:** `app/schools/[schoolCode]/admin/promotions/page.tsx`
  - Added promotion mode selection (class-by-class vs bulk)
  - Added bulk promotion preview and confirmation
  - Enhanced user experience with clear warnings

### **Phase 5: Database Schema** âœ…

- **Verified:** All required tables exist
  - `StudentArrear` - For tracking carried forward balances
  - `AcademicYear` - For academic year management
  - `Term` - For term management
  - `ClassProgression` - For class progression rules

### **Phase 6: Testing & Documentation** âœ…

- **Created:** `scripts/test-promotion.js` - Validation script
- **Created:** `docs/PROMOTION_SYSTEM.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- **Test Results:** âœ… All tests passed successfully

## ðŸŽ¯ **YOUR PROPOSED LOGIC - IMPLEMENTED**

### âœ… **1. Promote All Classes and All Students**

- **Implementation:** Bulk promotion service processes ALL classes and ALL students
- **API:** `POST /api/schools/{schoolCode}/promotions/bulk`
- **UI:** "School-Wide Bulk Promotion" mode

### âœ… **2. Remove Academic Year Change Logic**

- **Implementation:** Existing promotion API no longer changes student academic year/term
- **Result:** Students keep their current academic year/term during class promotion

### âœ… **3. Move Student to Next Class**

- **Implementation:** Only `classId` is updated during promotion
- **Result:** Students move to next class, teacher changes, class associations update

### âœ… **4. Change Calendar on Promotion**

- **Implementation:** Bulk promotion automatically:
  - Increments academic year by 1
  - Sets term to "Term 1"
  - Creates new year/term if missing

### âœ… **5. Create Academic Year/Term if Missing**

- **Implementation:** Automatic creation following conventions:
  - Year: `2025` â†’ `2026`
  - Term: `Term 1`, `Term 2`, `Term 3` or `Semester 1`, `Semester 2`

### âœ… **6. Save Student Arrears**

- **Implementation:**
  - Gets last running balance from fee statements
  - Saves to `StudentArrear` table with new academic year
  - Tracks carried forward amounts
