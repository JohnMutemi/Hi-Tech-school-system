- **Fee Structures**: Grade-appropriate fee structures for each term

#### Usage:
```typescript
const seedingService = new SchoolSeedingService(schoolId, schoolCode);
const results = await seedingService.seedSchoolData();
```

## Setup Workflow

### Step 1: Fee Structure Templates
1. Choose from 4 pre-built templates
2. Preview template contents
3. Download for customization (optional)
4. Import directly or upload customized version

### Step 2: Create Classes
1. One-click class creation for all grades
2. Automatic academic year and term creation
3. Grade-appropriate class naming (Grade 1A, 1B, etc.)

### Step 3: Sample Students
1. Create 2 students per grade automatically
2. Generate realistic student data
3. Create parent accounts with credentials
4. Display real-time fee balances

### Step 4: Review & Complete
1. Review all created data
2. See setup summary
3. Get next steps guidance
4. Complete setup and go live

## Real Fee Balance Integration

### How It Works:
1. **Fee Structures Created**: Default fee structures created for each grade/term combination
2. **Students Enrolled**: Students automatically enrolled in appropriate academic year/term
3. **Balance Calculation**: Uses existing `FeeBalanceService` for real calculations
4. **Real-time Display**: Shows actual outstanding balances, not mock data

### Fee Breakdown by Grade:
- **Grades 1-2**: Basic fees (KES 7,000 total)
- **Grades 3-4**: Intermediate fees (KES 9,300 total)
- **Grades 5-6**: Advanced fees (KES 12,200 total)

## Benefits

### For School Administrators:
- **Faster Onboarding**: Complete setup in under 10 minutes
- **Real Data Testing**: Test with actual fee calculations from day one
- **No Guesswork**: Pre-configured templates eliminate setup errors
- **Immediate Usability**: School is functional immediately after setup

### For Implementation Teams:
- **Reduced Support**: Self-service setup reduces support requests
- **Consistent Setup**: Standardized process ensures quality
- **Faster Deployment**: Schools can be onboarded in minutes, not hours
- **Real Testing Environment**: Clients can test with real data immediately

### For End Users:
- **Familiar Interface**: Standard fee structures match expectations
- **Real Balance Display**: See actual calculations, not placeholder data
- **Complete Parent Portal**: Parents can log in and see real balances
- **Working Payment System**: All payment flows work with real data

## Technical Integration

### Database Schema Compatibility:
- Works with existing Prisma schema
- Uses platform-level grades when available
- Falls back to school-specific grades if needed
- Integrates with existing fee calculation engine

### Error Handling:
- Non-blocking seeding (school creation succeeds even if seeding fails)
- Comprehensive error logging
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- Manual seeding option if automatic fails

### Performance:
- Efficient batch operations
- Minimal database queries
- Async processing for better UX
- Progress feedback during long operations

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:

- **Regional Customization**: Country-specific fee structures

## Conclusion

The simplified setup system transforms the school onboarding experience from a complex, error-prone process into a streamlined, guided workflow that produces immediately usable results with real data. Schools can now be fully operational within minutes of creation, with real fee balances, working parent portals, and complete academic structures in place.
