# Receipt Download Button Fix

## üêõ Issue Description

The download receipt button in the bursar dashboard was not opening the receipt modal to allow downloading receipts in various sizes (A3, A4, A5). Users would click the "Receipt" button but the modal with download options would not appear properly.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `BursarReceiptModal` component where the `showActions` prop was incorrectly set to `isOpen` instead of `true`.

**Problem Location**: `components/bursar/BursarReceiptModal.tsx`

**Before (causing the issue)**:
```typescript
export function BursarReceiptModal({ isOpen, onClose, receiptData }: BursarReceiptModalProps) {
  if (!receiptData) return null;

  return (
    <EnhancedReceipt
      receiptData={receiptData}
      onClose={onClose}
      showActions={isOpen}  // ‚ùå Wrong: This should always be true
    />
  );
}
```

The `showActions` prop controls whether the download buttons (A3, A4, A5, TXT, Print) are displayed in the receipt modal. Setting it to `isOpen` meant that even when the modal was open, the action buttons might not be shown.

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied

**After (fixed)**:
```typescript
export function BursarReceiptModal({ isOpen, onClose, receiptData }: BursarReceiptModalProps) {
  if (!receiptData || !isOpen) return null;  // Added isOpen check for better control

  return (
    <EnhancedReceipt
      receiptData={receiptData}
      onClose={onClose}
      showActions={true}  // ‚úÖ Fixed: Always show action buttons when modal is open
    />
  );
}
```

### Changes Made:

1. **Fixed `showActions` prop**: Changed from `showActions={isOpen}` to `showActions={true}`
2. **Improved null checking**: Added `!isOpen` to the return null condition for better control
3. **Ensured consistency**: Verified that parent dashboard `ReceiptComponent` was already correct

## üéØ Expected Behavior Now

### Bursar Dashboard:
1. ‚úÖ User clicks "Receipt" button next to any payment

   - **TXT** download button
   - **Print** button
   - **Close** button (X)
4. ‚úÖ User can click any download button to get receipt in desired format
